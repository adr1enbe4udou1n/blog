Hi folks, I'm a french web lover actually working [@Cesson-S√©vign√©](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesson-S%C3%A9vign%C3%A9), mastering `Vue 3` and `Typescript` on frontend side as well as `Laravel` and `ASP.NET Core` as main backend frameworks. Use preferably utility-first CSS framework as `Tailwind` / `Windi CSS`, but also comfortable with `Sass` with **BEM** implementation.

I love develop proper API design following `DDD` + `Hexa` principles if applicable. My favorite backend stack is `ASP.NET Core` and `C#`. I'm also comfortable with [`Nest.js`](https://nestjs.com/) associated to [`MikroORM`](https://mikro-orm.io/) (*Typescript*), [`FastAPI`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) (*Python*), and [`Spring Boot`](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) (*Java*).

I encourage `TDD` or at least proper **integration tests** on any backend frameworks, following `AAA` aka *Arrange Act Assert* principle. Mastering `PHPUnit` or [`Pest`](https://pestphp.com/) for *PHP*, `xUnit.net` with [`Fluent Assertions`](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions) for *.NET Core*, `JUnit` with [`REST Assured`](https://rest-assured.io/) for *Spring Boot*, `Jest` and `pytest` on respective *NodeJS* end *Python* stacks.

Fully embracing app containerization with `Docker`, from local, staging to production. I push to use properly configured `CI/CD` whenever is possible in order to enforce linting and coding standard at any languages ([`ESLint`](https://eslint.org/), [`Prettier`](https://prettier.io/), [`PHP CS fixer`](https://cs.symfony.com/), [`PHPStan`](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan), [`Black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [`mypy`](http://mypy-lang.org/), and so on...). I personally use [`Drone CI`](https://www.drone.io/) and `GitLab` as main CI/CD solutions.

Mastering installations of `Docker Swarm` clusters with [`Traefik`](https://traefik.io/traefik/) as cloud proxy and [`Portainer`](https://www.portainer.io/) as nice GUI for cluster management. I use `Loki`, `Prometheus` and `Jaeger` as respective *logging*, *metrics* and *tracing* tools, all combined to `Grafana` as GUI dashboard builder for *Ops*. Have some experiences with many cloud providers as [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/), [OVH](https://www.ovhcloud.com/), [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/).
