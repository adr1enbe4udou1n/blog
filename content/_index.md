I'm a digital lover that do many things around Web development, including some *DevOps*. Mastering `Vue 3` with `Typescript` for frontend as well as `Laravel` and `Symfony` as main backend frameworks on modern `PHP 8+`.

I love develop proper API design following `DDD` + `Hexa` principles if applicable. My favorite backend stack is `ASP.NET Core` and `C#`. I'm also comfortable on [`Nest.js`](https://nestjs.com/) with combination on [`MikroORM`](https://mikro-orm.io/). I also used [`FastAPI`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) as well as `Spring Boot` (*Java*).

Furthermore, I encourage `TDD` or at least proper **integration tests** on all types of backend frameworks, following `AAA` aka *Arrange Act Assert* principle. Mastering `PHPUnit` or [`Pest`](https://pestphp.com/) for *PHP*, `xUnit.net` with [`Fluent Assertions`](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions) for *.NET Core*, `Jest` and `pytest` on respective *NodeJS* end *Python* stacks.

Fully embracing app containerization as `Docker`, from local, staging to production. I push to use `CI/CD` whenever is possible with proper configuration. I personally use [`Drone`](https://www.drone.io/) and `GitLab` as main CI/CD solutions.

Mastering installations of `Docker Swarm` clusters with [`Traefik`](https://traefik.io/traefik/) as cloud proxy and [`Portainer`](https://www.portainer.io/) as proper GUI system for cluster management. I personally use combinations of `Grafana`, `Loki`, `Prometheus`, `Jaeger` as main *logging*, *metrics* and *tracing* tools.
