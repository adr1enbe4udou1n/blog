Hi folks, I'm a web lover actually working [@Cesson-S√©vign√©](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesson-S%C3%A9vign%C3%A9), mastering :

* [`ASP.NET Core`](https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-6.0) with `C#` and [`Laravel`](https://laravel.com/) as main backend frameworks
* [`Vue 3`](https://vuejs.org/) associated with [`Typescript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [*Composition API*](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq.html) on frontend side
* *Utility-first CSS frameworks* as [`Tailwind`](https://tailwindcss.com/) / [`Windi CSS`](https://windicss.org/), but also comfortable with [`Sass`](https://sass-lang.com/) with **BEM** implementation

I can develop proper API design following [**DDD / Hexa**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) principles if applicable. In addition to above `.NET` and `PHP` backend stacks, I'm also confident with :

* [`Nest.js`](https://nestjs.com/) associated to [`MikroORM`](https://mikro-orm.io/) (*Typescript*),
* [`FastAPI`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) with [`SQLAlchemy`](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) (*Python*),
* [`Spring Boot`](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) with `Hibernate` as main JPA implementation (*Java*).

I encourage `TDD` or at least proper **integration tests** on any backend frameworks, following **AAA** aka *Arrange Act Assert* principle :

* `PHPUnit` or [`Pest`](https://pestphp.com/) for *PHP*,
* [`NUnit.net`](https://nunit.org/) or [xUnit.net](https://xunit.net/) with [`Fluent Assertions`](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions) for *.NET Core*,
* `JUnit` with [`REST Assured`](https://rest-assured.io/) for *Spring Boot*,
* `Jest` and `pytest` on respective *NodeJS* end *Python* stacks.

Fully embracing app containerization with `Docker`, from local, staging to production, I push to use properly configured **CI/CD** whenever is possible in order to enforce **continuous automatized testing, linting and coding standard** at many languages ([`ESLint`](https://eslint.org/), [`Prettier`](https://prettier.io/), [`PHP CS fixer`](https://cs.symfony.com/), [`PHPStan`](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan), [`Black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [`mypy`](http://mypy-lang.org/), [`Google Java Format`](https://github.com/google/google-java-format), [`Spotless`](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless), and so on...).

Mastering installations of properly configured `Docker Swarm` clusters with next containerized tools :

* [`Traefik`](https://traefik.io/traefik/) as main cloud proxy with automatic service discovery and SSL configuration
* [`Portainer`](https://www.portainer.io/) as simple GUI for containers management
* [`Loki`](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/), [`Prometheus`](https://prometheus.io) and [`Jaeger`](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) as respective *logging*, *metrics* and *tracing* tools
* [`Grafana`](https://grafana.com) as perfect GUI dashboard builder for *Ops*
* [`GitLab`](https://about.gitlab.com/) or [`Gitea`](https://gitea.io/) coupled with [`Drone CI`](https://www.drone.io/) as both *self-hosted CI/CD* solutions
* [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) for automatic quality code scan

I use managed [`PostgreSQL`](https://www.postgresql.org/), [`MySQL`](https://www.mysql.com/fr/), and `MSSQL` as main **SGBD**, as well as `Redis` for high performance cache/sessions management.

For *load testing*, I can write scenarios for both [`K6`](https://k6.io/) and [`Locust`](https://locust.io/), coupled with proper time series DB as [`InfluxDB`](https://www.influxdata.com/) and `Grafana` as visualization tool. For advanced application performance analysis, I tend to use [`OpenTelemetry`](https://opentelemetry.io/) as collection tools for proper metrics that can be exposed to `Prometheus`, and tracing, ready to export into `Jaeger`.

Have some experiences with many mid-range cloud providers as [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/), [OVH](https://www.ovhcloud.com/), [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/).
