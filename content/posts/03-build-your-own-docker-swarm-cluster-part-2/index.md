Build your own cheap but powerful self-hosted cluster and be free from any SaaS solutions by following this opinionated guide üéâ
{{< /lead >}}

This is the **Part II** of more global topic tutorial. [Back to first part]({{< ref "/posts/02-build-your-own-docker-swarm-cluster" >}}) for intro.

## Requirements üõë

Before continue I presume you have :

* Hetzner cloud account ready
* Installed [hcloud cli](https://github.com/hetznercloud/cli)
* Have a local account SSH key

Initiate the project by following this simple steps :

1. Create the project through the UI (I will use `swarmrocks` as project's name here)
2. Navigate to security > API tokens
3. Generate new API key with *Read Write* permissions and copy the generated token

[![Hetzner API Token](hetzner-api-token.png)](hetzner-api-token.png)

Then go to the terminal and prepare the new context.

```sh
hcloud context create swarmrocks # set the copied token at prompt
hcloud context list # check that your new project is active

# set your ssh public key to the project, mine is .ssh/id_ed25519.pub
hcloud ssh-key create --name swarm --public-key-from-file .ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Note as we don't need to return to the Hetzner UI anymore, all the rest is pure CLI. We're ready to set up the cluster architecture presented in the first part !

## Create the cloud servers and networks ‚òÅÔ∏è

```sh
# create private network
hcloud network create --name network-01 --ip-range 10.0.0.0/16

# create a subnet for the network
hcloud network add-subnet network-01 --type server --network-zone eu-central --ip-range 10.0.0.0/24

# create manager server
hcloud server create --name manager-01 --ssh-key swarm --image ubuntu-20.04 --type cx21 --location nbg1 --network network-01

# create worker server
hcloud server create --name worker-01 --ssh-key swarm --image ubuntu-20.04 --type cx21 --location nbg1 --network network-01

# create runner server
hcloud server create --name runner-01 --ssh-key swarm --image ubuntu-20.04 --type cpx11 --location nbg1 --network network-01

# create data server
hcloud server create --name data-01 --ssh-key swarm --image ubuntu-20.04 --type cx21 --location nbg1 --network network-01

# create the volume that will be used by gluster and automount it to the data server (fstab will be already setted)
hcloud volume create --name volume-01 --size 20 --server data-01 --automount --format ext4
```

{{< alert >}}
Location is important ! Choose wisely between Germany, Finland and US. Here I go for `nbg1`, aka Nuremberg.
{{< /alert >}}

## Prepare the servers üõ†Ô∏è

It's time to do the classic minimal boring viable security setup for each server. Use `hcloud server ssh xxxxxx-01` for ssh connect and apply the same following commands for each nodes.

```sh
# ensure last upgrades
apt update && apt upgrade -y && reboot

# configure your locales and timezone
dpkg-reconfigure locales
dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

# create your default non root user (swarm in this sample)
adduser swarm # enter any strong password at prompt

# set the user to sudoer group and sync the same ssh root key
usermod -aG sudo swarm
rsync --archive --chown=swarm:swarm ~/.ssh /home/swarm

# setting vim for personal taste and remove sudo password
update-alternatives --config editor
visudo # replace %sudo... line by %sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

# finally change default ssh port by anything else
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config # Port 2222
service ssh reload
```

{{< alert >}}
The change of SSH port is not only for better security, but also for allowing more later git ssh operations into your custom git provider as GitLab, Gitea, etc. that will pass through Traefik 22 port, which will be far more practical.
{{< /alert >}}

Finally, test your new `swarm` user by using `hcloud server ssh --user swarm --port 2222 xxxxxx-01` for each server and be sure that the user can do commands as sudo before continue.

Then edit `/etc/hosts` file for each server accordingly for internal DNS :

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab tabName="manager-01" >}}

{{< highlight filename="/etc/hosts" >}}

```txt
10.0.0.3 worker-01 sw-worker-01
10.0.0.4 runner-01 sw-runner-01
10.0.0.5 data-01 sw-data-01
```

{{< /highlight >}}

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab tabName="worker-01" >}}

{{< highlight filename="/etc/hosts" >}}

```txt
10.0.0.2 manager-01
10.0.0.5 data-01
```

{{< /highlight >}}

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab tabName="runner-01" >}}

{{< highlight filename="/etc/hosts" >}}

```txt
10.0.0.2 manager-01
10.0.0.5 data-01
```

{{< /highlight >}}

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

{{< alert >}}
IPs are only showed here as samples, use `hcloud server describe xxxxxx-01` in order to get the right private IP under `Private Net`.
{{< /alert >}}

## Setup DNS and SSH config üåç

Now use `hcloud server ip manager-01` to get the unique frontal IP address of the cluster that will be used for any entry point, including SSH. Then edit the DNS of your domain and apply this IP to a particular subdomain, as well as a wildcard subdomain. You will see later what this wildcard domain is it for. I will use `sw.dockerswarm.rocks` as sample. It should be looks like next :

```txt
sw      3600    IN A        123.123.123.123
*.sw    43200   IN CNAME    sw
```

As soon as the above DNS is applied, you should ping `sw.dockerswarm.rocks` or any `xyz.sw.dockerswarm.rocks` domains.

It's now time to finalize your local SSH config for optimal access. Go to `~/.ssh/config` and add following hosts (change it accordingly to your own setup) :

```ssh
Host sw
    User swarm
    Port 2222
    HostName sw.dockerswarm.rocks

Host sw-data-01
    User swarm
    HostName sw-data-01
    ProxyCommand ssh sw -W %h:2222

Host sw-runner-01
    User swarm
    HostName sw-runner-01
    ProxyCommand ssh sw -W %h:2222

Host sw-worker-01
    User swarm
    HostName sw-worker-01
    ProxyCommand ssh sw -W %h:2222
```

And that's it ! You should now quickly ssh to these servers easily by `ssh sw`, `ssh sw-worker-01`, `ssh sw-runner-01`, `ssh sw-data-01`, which will be far more practical.

{{< alert >}}
Note as I only use the `sw.dockerswarm.rocks` as unique endpoint for ssh access to all internal server, without need of external SSH access to servers different from `manager-01`. It's known as SSH proxy, which allows single access point for better security perspective by simply jumping from main SSH access.
{{< /alert >}}

## The firewall üß±

Now it's time to finish this preparation section by putting some security.
You should never let any cluster without properly configured firewall. It's generally preferable to use the cloud provider firewall instead of standard `ufw` because more easy to manage, no risk of being stupidly blocked, and settled once and for all.

You need at least 2 firewalls :

1. One for external incoming for SSH and Traefik web standard ports. You'll need a full set of rules, and it will be only enabled for `manager-01`. The main SSH port will be IP whitelisted to your public IP only.
2. The second firewall is for block all **any** incoming requests applied to any servers different from the `manager-01`, even for SSH as we don't need it anymore thanks to above SSH proxy.

{{< alert >}}
Note as the Hetzner Cloud Firewall will not apply to the private network at all, as it's [already considered to be "secured"](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/firewalls/faq/#can-firewalls-secure-traffic-to-my-private-hetzner-cloud-networks) ! I hope so, but I'm pretty sure that it will be possible to set a firewall in private networks in the future as we can just believe Hetzner word for word.  
How can be sure that any other internal client has no access to our private network ? Use `ufw` if you're paranoid about that...
{{< /alert >}}

Create the 2 firewalls as next :

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab tabName="bash" >}}

```sh
# internal firewall to protect internal server from all external access
hcloud firewall create --name firewall-internal
hcloud firewall apply-to-resource firewall-internal --type server --server worker-01
hcloud firewall apply-to-resource firewall-internal --type server --server runner-01
hcloud firewall apply-to-resource firewall-internal --type server --server data-01

# external firewall to protect manager-01 with only required ports
# use the json file from the 2nd tab just above
hcloud firewall create --name firewall-external --rules-file firewall-rules.json
hcloud firewall apply-to-resource firewall-external --type server --server manager-01
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab tabName="firewall-rules.json" >}}

```json
[
    {
        "direction": "in",
        "port": "22",
        "protocol": "tcp",
        "source_ips": [
            "0.0.0.0/0",
            "::/0"
        ]
    },
    {
        "direction": "in",
        "port": "80",
        "protocol": "tcp",
        "source_ips": [
            "0.0.0.0/0",
            "::/0"
        ]
    },
    {
        "direction": "in",
        "port": "443",
        "protocol": "tcp",
        "source_ips": [
            "0.0.0.0/0",
            "::/0"
        ]
    },
    {
        "direction": "in",
        "port": "2222",
        "protocol": "tcp",
        "source_ips": [
            "xx.xx.xx.xx/32"
        ]
    }
]
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

{{< alert >}}
Adapt the 4st rule of `firewall-rules.json` accordingly to your own chosen SSH port and set your own public IP inside `source_ips` in place of `xx.xx.xx.xx` value for better security. In case you have dynamic IP, just remove this last rule.
{{< /alert >}}

You should have now good protection against any unintended external access with only few required ports to your `manager-01` server, aka :

| port     | description                                                                                                            |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **2222** | the main SSH port, with IP whitelist                                                                                   |
| **443**  | the HTTPS port for Traefik, our main access for all of your web apps                                                   |
| **80**   | the HTTP port for Traefik, only required for proper HTTPS redirection                                                  |
| **22**   | the SSH standard port for Traefik, required for proper usage through you main Git provider container as GitLab / Gitea |

## Network file system üìÑ

Before go further away, we'll quickly need of proper unique shared storage location for all managers and workers. It's mandatory in order to keep same state when your app containers are automatically rearranged by Swarm manager across multiple workers for convergence purpose.

We'll use `GlusterFS` for that. You can of course use a simple NFS bind mount. But GlusterFS make more sense in the sense that it allows easy replication for HA. You will not regret it when you'll need a `data-02`. We'll not cover GlusterFS replication here, just a unique master replica.

Note that manager node can be used as worker as well. However, I think it's not well suited for production apps in my opinion.

### Install GlusterFS üêú

It's 2 steps :

* Installing the file system server on dedicated volume mounted on `data-01`
* Mount the above volume on all clients where docker is installed

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab tabName="1. master (data-01)" >}}

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:gluster/glusterfs-10

sudo apt install -y glusterfs-server
sudo systemctl enable glusterd.service
sudo systemctl start glusterd.service

# get the path of you mounted disk from part 1 of this tuto
df -h # it should be like /mnt/HC_Volume_xxxxxxxx

# create the volume
sudo gluster volume create volume-01 data-01:/mnt/HC_Volume_xxxxxxxx/gluster-storage
sudo gluster volume start volume-01

# ensure volume is present with this command
sudo gluster volume status

# next line for testing purpose
sudo touch /mnt/HC_Volume_xxxxxxxx/gluster-storage/test.txt
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab tabName="2. clients (docker hosts)" >}}

```sh
# do following commands on every docker client host
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:gluster/glusterfs-10

sudo apt install -y glusterfs-client

# I will choose this path as main bind mount
sudo mkdir /mnt/storage-pool

# edit /etc/fstab with following line for persistent mount
data-01:/volume-01 /mnt/storage-pool glusterfs defaults,_netdev,x-systemd.automount 0 0

# test fstab with next command
sudo mount -a

# you should see test.txt
ls /mnt/storage-pool/
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

{{< alert >}}
You can ask why we use bind mounts directly on the host instead of using more featured docker volumes directly (Kubernetes does similar way). Moreover, it's not really the first recommendation on [official docs](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/), as it states to prefer volumes directly.  
It's just as I didn't find reliable GlusterFS driver working for Docker. Kubernetes is far more mature in this domain sadly. Please let me know if you know production grade solution for that !

We've done all the boring nevertheless essential stuff of this tutorial by preparing the physical layer + OS part + cloud native NFS.

Go to the [next part]({{< ref "/posts/04-build-your-own-docker-swarm-cluster-part-3" >}}) for the serious work !
