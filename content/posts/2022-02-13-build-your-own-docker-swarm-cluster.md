Build your own cheap while powerful self-hosted complete CI/CD solution by following this opinionated guide üéâ

## Why Docker Swarm üßê ?

Because [Docker Swarm Rocks](https://dockerswarm.rocks/) !

Even if Docker Swarm has lost the enterprise graduate orchestration containers war, you don't have to throw yourself into all Kubernetes fuzzy complicated things for a simple homelab, unless for custom training of course.

If you know how to use docker-compose, you're already ready for Docker Swarm which use almost the same API with addition of specific *deploy* config.

I'll try to show you step by step how to install your own cheap containerized cluster for less than $30 by using [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/), one of the best Cloud provider on European market, with cheap but powerful VPS.

So the prerequisites before continue :

* Have some knowledge on docker-compose setups
* Be comfortable with SSH terminal
* Registered for a [Hetzner Cloud account](https://accounts.hetzner.com/signUp)
* A custom domain, I'll use `example.org` here

You can of course apply this guide on any other cloud provider, but I doubt that you can achieve lower price.

## Final goal üéØ

In the end of this multi-steps guide, you will have complete working production grade secured cluster, backup included, with optional monitoring and complete development CI/CD workflow.

### The stateful part for data üíæ

For all data critical part, I choose to use **1 dedicated VPS**. We will install :

* `PostgreSQL` as main production database
* `GlusterFS` as network filesystem
* `MySQL`, `MongoDB`, `Redis` as optional storage tools
* `Elasticsearch` that will be used for tracing storage (`Jaeger`)
* `Loki` with `Promtail` for centralized logs
* `Restic` for backups to external S3 compatible bucket

{{< alert >}}
There are many debates about using databases as docker container, but I personally prefer use managed server for better control, local on-disk performance, central backup management and easier possibility of database clustering.  
Note as on the Kubernetes world, run containerized databases becomes reality thanks to [powerful operators](https://github.com/zalando/postgres-operator) that provide easy clustering. The is obviously no such things on Docker Swarm üôà

### The stateless part, aka cluster üöÜ

#### Cluster initialization üåç

* `Docker Swarm` installation, **1 manager and 2 workers**
* `Traefik`, a cloud native reverse proxy with automatic service discovery and SSL configuration
* `Portainer` as simple GUI for containers management

#### Testing with some initial containerized tools ‚úÖ

* `pgAdmin` and `phpMyAdmin` as web database managers (optional)
* [`Diun`](https://crazymax.dev/diun/) (optional), very useful in order to be notified for all used images update inside your Swarm cluster
* Some demo containerized samples that will show you how simple is it to install self-hosted web apps thanks to your shiny new cluster as `redmine`, `n8n`

#### Monitoring (optional) üìà

* `Prometheus` as time series DB for monitoring, with many exporter (Node, PostgreSQL, MySQL Cadvisor, Traefik)
* `Jaeger` as *tracing* tools
* `Grafana` as GUI dashboard builder with many battery included dashboards
  * Monitoring all the cluster
  * Node, PostgreSQL and MySQL metrics
  * Navigate through log history of all containers and data server node thanks to `Loki` like *ELK*, with LogQL

#### CI/CD Development workflow (optional) üíª

* `Gitea` as lightweight centralized control version, in case you want get out of Github / GitLab Cloud
* `Private docker registry` with minimal UI for all your custom app images that will be built on your development process and be used as based image for your production docker on cluster
* `Drone CI` as self-hosted CI/CD solution
* `SonarQube` as self-hosted quality code control

Finally, we'll finish this guide by a simple mini-app development with above CI/CD integration !

## Cluster Architecture üèòÔ∏è

Note as this cluster will be intended for developer user with complete self-hosted CI/CD solution. So for a good cluster architecture starting point, we can imagine the following nodes :

* `manager-01` : The frontal manager node, with proper reverse proxy and some management tools
* `worker-01` : A worker for your production/staging apps
* `runner-01` : An additional worker dedicated to CI/CD pipelines execution
* `data-01` : The critical data node, with attached and resizable volume for better flexibility

{{< alert >}}
For a simple production cluster, you can start with only `manager-01` and `data-01` as absolutely minimal start.  
For a development perspective, you can skip `worker-01` and use `manager-01` for production running.  
You have plenty choices here according to your budget !

### Hetzner VPS üñ•Ô∏è

Here some of the cheapest VPS options we have :

* **CPX11 (AMD)** = 2C/2G/40Go = **‚Ç¨4.79**
* **CX21 (Intel)** = 3C/4G/80Go = **‚Ç¨5.88**
* **CPX21 (AMD)** = 3C/4G/80Go = **‚Ç¨8.28**

My personal choice for a good balance between cheap and well-balanced cluster :

* `manager-01` : **CX21**, I'll privilege RAM
* `runner-01` : **CPX11**, 2 powerful core is better for building
* `worker-01` and `data-01` : **CX21 VS CPX21** (just a power choice matter)

We'll take additional volume of **60 Go** for **‚Ç¨2.88**

We finally arrive to following respectable budget range : **‚Ç¨25.31** - **$31.31**

The only difference being choice between **Xeon VS EPIC** as CPU power for `worker` and `data` nodes, which will our main production application nodes. A quick [sysbench](https://github.com/akopytov/sysbench) will indicates around **70-80%** more power for AMD (test date from 2022-02).
Choose wisely according to your needs.

If you don't need of `worker` and `runner` nodes, with only one simple standalone docker host without Swarm mode, you can even go down to **‚Ç¨14,64** with only **2 CX21** in addition to volume.

{{< alert >}}
If you intend to have your own self-hosted GitLab for an enterprise grade CI/CD workflow, you should run it on node with **8¬†GB** of RAM.  
**4 GB** is doable if you run just one single GitLab container on it with Prometheus mode disabled and external PostgreSQL.
