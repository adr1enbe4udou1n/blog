This is the **Part IV** of more global topic tutorial. [Back to first part]({{< ref "/posts/10-build-your-own-kubernetes-cluster" >}}) for intro.

## Resilient storage with Longhorn

In Kubernetes world, the most difficult while essential part is probably the storage. It's not easy to find a solution that combine resiliency, scalability and performance.

{{< alert >}}
If you are not familiar with Kubernetes storage, you must at least be aware of pros and cons of `RWO` and `RWX` volumes when creating `PVC`.  
In general `RWO` is more performant, but only one pod can mount it, while `RWX` is slower, but allow sharing between multiple pods.  
`RWO` is a single node volume, and `RWX` is a shared volume between multiple nodes.
{{</ alert >}}

`K3s` come with a built-in `local-path` provisioner, which is the most performant `RWO` solution by directly using local NVMe SSD. But it's not resilient neither scalable. I think it's a good solution for what you consider at no critical data.

A dedicated NFS server is a good `RWX` solution, by using [this provisioner](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner). It allows scalability and resiliency with [GlusterFS](https://www.gluster.org/). But it stays a single point of failure in case of network problems, and give of course low IOPs. It's also a separate server to maintain.

For Hetzner, the easiest `RWO` solution is to use the [official CSI](https://github.com/hetznercloud/csi-driver) for automatic block volumes mounting. It's far more performant than NFS (but still less than local SSD), but there is no resiliency neither scalability. It's really easy to go with and very resource efficient for the cluster, note that multiple pods can [reference same volume](https://github.com/hetznercloud/csi-driver/issues/146) which allow reusability without wasting 10 GB each time.

As a more advanced solution storage, [Longhorn](https://longhorn.io/) seems to get some traction by combining most requirements with nice UI, with the price of high resource usage inside cluster. Moreover, it offers integrated backup solution with snapshots and remote S3, which avoid us to have to manage a dedicated backup solution like [velero](https://velero.io/) and some annotations for each pod volumes to be backup.

### Storage node pool

When it comes storage management, it's generally recommended having a dedicated node pool for it for better scalability.

end

Let's get back to our 1st Hcloud Terraform Project, and add a new node pool for storage:

{{< highlight file="kube.tf" >}}

```tf
module "hcloud_kube" {
  //...

  agent_nodepools = [
    //...
    {
      name              = "storage"
      server_type       = "cx21"
      location          = "nbg1"
      count             = 2
      private_interface = "ens10"
      labels = [
        "node.kubernetes.io/server-usage=storage"
      ]
      taints = [
        "node-role.kubernetes.io/storage:NoSchedule"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

{{< /highlight >}}

Be sure to have labels and taints correctly set, as we'll use them later for Longhorn installation. This node pool will be dedicated for storage, so the tainted label will prevent any other pod workload to be scheduled on it.

After `terraform apply`, check that new storage nodes are ready with `kgno`. Now we'll also apply a configurable dedicated block volume on each node for more flexible space management.

{{< highlight file="kube.tf" >}}

```tf
module "hcloud_kube" {
  //...

  agent_nodepools = [
    //...
    {
      name        = "storage"
      //...
      volume_size = 10
    }
  ]
}
```

{{< /highlight >}}

SSH to both storage nodes to check if a 20GB volume is correctly mounted by `df -h` command. It should be like :

```txt
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1        38G  4,2G   32G  12% /
...
/dev/sdb         20G   24K 19,5G   1% /mnt/HC_Volume_XXXXXXXX
```

The volume is of course automatically mounted on each node reboot, it's done via `fstab`.

{{< alert >}}
Note as if you set volume in same time as node pool creation, Hetzner doesn't seem to automatically mount the volume. So it's preferable to create the node pool first, then add the volume as soon as the node in ready state. You can always delete and recreate volume by commenting then uncommenting `volume_size` variable, which will force a remount properly.

### Longhorn installation

Return to the 2nd Kubernetes terraform project, and add Longhorn installation:

{{< highlight file="longhorn.tf" >}}

```tf

```

## PostgreSQL with replication

## Redis cluster

## Backups (dumps + longhorn snapshots)

## 3th check âœ…

Persistence is now insured by Longhorn as a resilient storage and a DB replicated cluster. It's now time to test some [real world apps]({{< ref "/posts/13-build-your-own-kubernetes-cluster-part-4" >}}) with a proper CD solution.
