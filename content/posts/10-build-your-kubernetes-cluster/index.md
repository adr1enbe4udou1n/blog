{{< lead >}}
Be free from AWS/Azure/GCP by building a production grade On-Premise Kubernetes cluster on cheap VPS provider, fully GitOps managed, and with complete CI/CD tools üéâ
{{< /lead >}}

## The goal üéØ

This guide is mainly intended for any developers or some SRE who want to build a Kubernetes cluster that respect following conditions :

1. **On-Premise management** (The Hard Way), so no vendor lock in to any managed Kubernetes provider (KaaS/CaaS)
2. Hosted on affordable VPS provider (**Hetzner**), with strong **Terraform support**, allowing **GitOps** principles
3. **High Availability** with cloud Load Balancer, resilient storage and DB with replication, allowing automatic upgrades or maintenance without any downtime for production apps
4. Include complete **monitoring**, **logging** and **tracing** stacks
5. Complete **CI/CD pipeline**
6. Budget target **~60$/month** for complete cluster with all above tools, can be far less if no need for HA, CI or monitoring features

### What you'll learn üìö

* How to set up an On-Premise resilient Kubernetes cluster with Terraform, from the ground up, with automatic upgrades and reboot
* Using Terraform to manage your infrastructure, for both cloud provider and Kubernetes, following the GitOps principles
* Using [K3s](https://k3s.io/) as lightweight Kubernetes distribution
* Using [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) as ingress controller, combined to [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) for distributed SSL certificates
* Using [Longhorn](https://longhorn.io/) for resilient storage and PostgreSQL with replication
* Installing critical statefulsets as **PostgreSQL** and **Redis** clusters via well-known Bitnami Helms
* Manage Continuous Delivery with [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/), and test it with some No Code apps, as [n8n](https://n8n.io/), [nocodb](https://nocodb.com/)
* Complete monitoring solution with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/), and [Tempo](https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/) for distributed tracing
* Mount a complete self-hosted CI pipeline with the lightweight [Gitea](https://gitea.io/) + [Concourse CI](https://concourse-ci.org/) combo
* Test above CI tools with a sample **.NET app**, with automatic CD thanks to Flux, and integrate it to monitoring stack with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)
* Go further with [SonarQube](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarqube/) for advanced code quality analysis
* Test the app / cluster with some load testing with [k6](https://k6.io/)

### You may don't need Kubernetes üßê

If you prefer to stay away of all overwhelming Kubernetes features, but just interested in a very simple self-hosted orchestration platform (as 99% of any personal usage), keep in mind that **Docker Swarm** is probably the best solution for you. Don't listen people that say it's outdated, because [it's not](https://dockerlabs.collabnix.com/intermediate/swarm/difference-between-docker-swarm-vs-swarm-mode-vs-swarmkit.html) and will always be supported as long as Docker CE live, as it's built in into the Docker Engine, and it's far easier and cheaper to maintain it than K8S. The downside is that there is no longer any new features added to Swarm.

I wrote a [complete dedicated guide here]({{< ref "/posts/02-build-your-own-docker-swarm-cluster" >}}) that explains all steps in order to have a production grade Swarm cluster.

### Cloud provider choice

As a HA Kubernetes cluster can be quickly expensive, a good cloud provider is an essential part.

After testing many providers, as Digital Ocean, Vultr, Linode, Civo , OVH, Scaleway, it seems like **Hetzner** is very well suited **in my opinion** :

* Very competitive price for middle-range performance (plan only around **$6** for 2CPU/4GB for each node)
* No frills, just the basics, VMs, block volumes, load balancer, DNS, firewall, and that's it
* Simple nice UI + CLI tool
* Official [Terraform support](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hetznercloud/hcloud/latest), so GitOps ready
* cert-manager [DSN01 challenge support](https://github.com/vadimkim/cert-manager-webhook-hetzner)

## Cluster Architecture üèòÔ∏è

Here are the nodes that we'll need for a complete self-hosted kubernetes cluster :

| server          | description                                                                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `controller-0x` | The control planes nodes, use at least 3 or any greater odd number (when etcd) for HA kube API server  |
| `worker-0x`     | Workers for your production/staging apps, at least 3 for running Longhorn for resilient storage        |
| `data-0x`       | Dedicated nodes for any DB / critical statefulset pods, recommended if you won't use managed databases |
| `monitor-0x`    | Workers dedicated for monitoring, optional                                                             |
| `runner-0x`     | Workers dedicated for CI/CD pipelines execution, optional                                              |

Basic target complete HA architecture for a basic app that needs replicated storage (with Longhorn) and DB (PostgreSQL) :

```mermaid
flowchart TD
lb((Load Balancer))
subgraph worker-01
    traefik-01([Traefik])
    app-01[App]
    longhorn-01[/Longhorn/]

    traefik-01 --> app-01
    longhorn-01 --> app-01
end
subgraph worker-02
    traefik-02([Traefik])
    app-02[App]
    longhorn-02[/Longhorn/]

    traefik-02 --> app-02
    longhorn-02 --> app-02
end
subgraph worker-03
    traefik-03([Traefik])
    app-03[App]
    longhorn-03[/Longhorn/]

    traefik-03 --> app-03
    longhorn-03 --> app-03
end
lb --> traefik-01
lb --> traefik-02
lb --> traefik-03
subgraph data [data-0x]
    direction LR
    postgresql[(PostgreSQL Primary)]
    postgresql-replica[(PostgreSQL Replica)]
end
app-01 --> data
app-02 --> data
app-03 --> data
postgresql --> postgresql-replica
```

## Cheap solution with Hetzner VPS üñ•Ô∏è

| Server Name  | Type     | Quantity                        | Unit Price |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------- | ---------- |
|              | **LB1**  |                                 | 5.39       |
| `manager-0x` | **CX21** | 1 or 3 for HA cluster           | 0.5 + 4.85 |
| `worker-0x`  | **CX21** | 3 minimum required for Longhorn | 0.5 + 4.85 |
| `data-0x`    | **CX21** | 2 for HA database               | 0.5 + 4.85 |
| `monitor-0x` | **CX21** | 1 can be enough                 | 0.5 + 4.85 |
| `runner-0x`  | **CX21** | 1 for start                     | 0.5 + 4.85 |

(5.39+**10**\*(0.5+4.85))*1.2 = **‚Ç¨70.67** / month

This is of course for a complete HA cluster, for a minimal working cluster, you can easily get down to **4 nodes**, i.e. **‚Ç¨32.15**. You can even get rid of Load Balancer and simply use basic DNS round-robin.
