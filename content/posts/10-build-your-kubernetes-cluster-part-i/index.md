Build your self-hosted Kubernetes cluster and be free from any SaaS solutions by following this opinionated guide 🎉
{{< /lead >}}

## For who

This guide is mainly intended for any developers that want a HA ready Kubernetes cluster that respect following conditions :

1. Completely bare-metal and self-hosted, with some GitOps way steps
2. Free from any big cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) which offers managed Kubernetes
3. Not too much expensive (targeting less than $50). For that Hetzner will be my preferred choice !

I will not risk saying that it's production ready, but it's a good start to build your own Kubernetes platform and quick learning all his ecosystem.
