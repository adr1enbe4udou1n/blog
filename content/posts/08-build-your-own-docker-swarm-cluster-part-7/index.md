Build your own cheap while powerful self-hosted complete CI/CD solution by following this opinionated guide üéâ
{{< /lead >}}

This is the **Part VII** of more global topic tutorial. [Back to first part]({{< ref "/posts/02-build-your-own-docker-swarm-cluster" >}}) to start from beginning.

## Self-hosted VCS üçµ

This specific VCS part is optional and is only for developers that would be completely independent of any cloud VCS providers, by self-hosting his own system.

{{< alert >}}
A backup is highly critical ! Don't underestimate that part and be sure to have a proper solution. **Restic** described in [this previous section]({{< ref "05-build-your-own-docker-swarm-cluster-part-4#data-backup-" >}}) is a perfect choice.
{{< /alert >}}

Of course, in a ~$30 cluster, forget about running a self-hosted GitLab, you will be forced to have an additionnal worker node with at least 4Gb fully dedicated just for running it. I will privilege here a super lightweight solution, Gitea. Besides, the last version 1.16 finally support dark mode !

### Install Gitea üíΩ

You guess it, it's just an additional stack to run !

Let's do `sudo mkdir /mnt/storage-pool/gitea`

Then create a new `gitea` stack :

```yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  gitea:
    image: gitea/gitea:1.16
    volumes:
      - /etc/hosts:/etc/hosts
      - /mnt/storage-pool/gitea:/data
    networks:
      - traefik_public
    deploy:
      labels:
        - traefik.enable=true
        - traefik.http.services.gitea.loadbalancer.server.port=3000
        - traefik.tcp.routers.gitea-ssh.rule=HostSNI(`*`)
        - traefik.tcp.routers.gitea-ssh.entrypoints=ssh
        - traefik.tcp.services.gitlab-ssh.loadbalancer.server.port=22
      placement:
        constraints:
          - node.role == manager

networks:
  traefik_public:
    external: true
```

{{< alert >}}
We added a specific TCP router in order to allow SSH cloning. The SSH Traefik entry point will redirect to the first available service with TCP router.  
Note as we need to indicate entry points in order to avoid bad redirection from other HTTPS based service.
{{< /alert >}}

Now go to <https://gitea.sw.okami101.io> and go through the installation procedure. Change default SQLite provider by a more production purpose database.

Create a new `gitea` PostgreSQL database as usual from pgAdmin or `psql` for pro-CLI user, and set the according DB info access to Gitea installer. Host should be `data-01`.

Don't forgive to change all domain related field by the proper current domain URL, which is `gitea.sw.okami101.io` in my case. You should set proper SMTP settings for notifications.

[![Gitea admin dashboard](gitea-install.png)](gitea-install.png)

For information all these settings are saved in `/mnt/storage-pool/gitea/gitea/conf/app.ini` file. You can change them at any time. You may want to disable registration by changing `DISABLE_REGISTRATION`.

Next just create your first account. The 1st account will be automatically granted to administrator.

[![Gitea admin dashboard](gitea-admin-dashboard.png)](gitea-admin-dashboard.png)

You should now test creating some repos and be sure that git cloning works on both HTTPS and SSH protocol. For SSH be sure to add your own SSH public key in your profile.

## Private docker registry

Before attack the CI/CD part, we should take care of where we put our main docker images that will be automatically be built when every code pushes. You have the choice to use main Docker hub of course but honestly, we have a full cluster now, let's use it fully !

### Install official docker registry üíΩ

We'll use the official docker registry with addition of nice simple UI for images navigation. It's always the same, do `sudo mkdir /mnt/storage-pool/registry` and create `registry` stack :

```yml
version: '3.3'

services:
  app:
    image: registry:2
    environment:
      REGISTRY_STORAGE_DELETE_ENABLED: 'true'
    volumes:
      - /mnt/storage-pool/registry:/var/lib/registry
    networks:
      traefik_public:
    deploy:
      labels:
        - traefik.enable=true
        - traefik.http.routers.registry.rule=Host(`registry.sw.okami101.io`) && PathPrefix(`/v2`)
        - traefik.http.routers.registry.middlewares=admin-auth
        - traefik.http.services.registry.loadbalancer.server.port=5000
      placement:
        constraints:
          - node.role == manager

  ui:
    image: joxit/docker-registry-ui
    environment:
      DELETE_IMAGES: 'true'
      SINGLE_REGISTRY: 'true'
    networks:
      traefik_public:
    deploy:
      labels:
        - traefik.enable=true
        - traefik.http.routers.registryui.middlewares=admin-auth
        - traefik.http.services.registryui.loadbalancer.server.port=80
      placement:
        constraints:
          - node.role == manager

networks:
  traefik_public:
    external: true
```

{{< alert >}}
Note as both service must be exposed to Traefik. In order to keep the same subdomain, we made usage of `PathPrefix` feature provided by Traefik with `/v2`.  
It gives us have an additional condition for redirect to the correct service. It's ok in our case because the official docker registry use only `/v2` as endpoint.
{{< /alert >}}

Go to <https://registry.sw.okami101.io> and use Traefik credentials. We have no images yet let's create one.

### Test our private registry

Login into the `manager-01` server, do `docker login registry.sw.okami101.io` and enter proper credentials. You should see *Login Succeeded*. Don't worry about the warning. Create the next Dockerfile somewhere :

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest
RUN apk add --no-cache git
```

Then build and push the image :

```sh
docker build -t alpinegit .
docker tag alpinegit registry.sw.okami101.io/alpinegit
docker push registry.sw.okami101.io/alpinegit
```

Go back to above <https://registry.sw.okami101.io>. You should see 1 new image !

[![Docker registry](docker-registry.png)](docker-registry.png)

Delete the image test through UI and from local docker with `docker image rm registry.sw.okami101.io/alpinegit`.

{{< alert >}}
Note as the blobs of image is always physically in the disk, even when "deleted". You must launch manually the docker GC in order to cleanup unused images.  
For that execute `registry garbage-collect /etc/docker/registry/config.yml` inside docker registry.
{{< /alert >}}

## CI/CD with Drone ü™Å

It's finally time to use our currently unused `runner-01` ! We'll use Drone as free self-hosted solution for docker image building. The all CI/CD process can be summarized to this flow chart :

{{< mermaid >}}
flowchart TD
subgraph manager-01
traefik((Traefik))
drone((Drone))
gitea((Gitea))
registry((Registry))
end
subgraph worker-01
my-app((My App 01))
end
subgraph runner-01
drone-runner((Drone runner))
end
traefik-->drone
traefik-->gitea
traefik-->registry
traefik-->my-app
gitea-- webhook on pushed code -->drone
drone-- start pipeline in runner -->drone-runner
gitea-- repo clone -->drone-runner
drone-runner-- push built docker image -->registry
registry-- pull image when deploy stack -->my-app
{{< /mermaid >}}

Let's follow [the official docs](https://docs.drone.io/server/provider/gitea/) for generating a OAuth2 application on Gitea, which is necessary for Drone integration. Set `https://drone.sw.okami101.io` as redirect UI after successful authentication.

[![Gitea drone application](gitea-drone-application.png)](gitea-drone-application.png)

Save and keep the client and secret tokens. Then create a new `drone` PostgreSQL database and create a new `drone` stack :

```yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  drone:
    image: drone/drone:2
    volumes:
      - /etc/hosts:/etc/hosts
    environment:
      DRONE_DATABASE_DRIVER: postgres
      DRONE_DATABASE_DATASOURCE: postgres://drone:${DRONE_DATABASE_PASSWORD}@data-01:5432/drone?sslmode=disable
      DRONE_GITEA_CLIENT_ID:
      DRONE_GITEA_CLIENT_SECRET:
      DRONE_GITEA_SERVER: https://gitea.sw.okami101.io
      DRONE_RPC_SECRET:
      DRONE_SERVER_HOST: drone.sw.okami101.io
      DRONE_SERVER_PROTO: https
      DRONE_USER_CREATE: username:adr1enbe4udou1n,admin:true
    networks:
      - traefik_public
    deploy:
      labels:
        - traefik.enable=true
        - traefik.http.services.drone.loadbalancer.server.port=80
      placement:
        constraints:
          - node.role == manager

  runner-docker:
    image: drone/drone-runner-docker
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    environment:
      DRONE_RPC_SECRET:
      DRONE_RPC_HOST: ${DRONE_SERVER_HOST}
      DRONE_RPC_PROTO: ${DRONE_SERVER_PROTO}
    deploy:
      placement:
        constraints:
          - node.labels.environment == build

networks:
  traefik_public:
    external: true
```

{{< alert >}}
Don't forget to have proper docker labels on nodes, as explain [here]({{< ref "04-build-your-own-docker-swarm-cluster-part-3#add-environment-labels" >}}), otherwise docker runner will not run because of `node.labels.environment == build`.
{{< /alert >}}

| `DRONE_DATABASE_PASSWORD`   | Use the database password                                                                                                       |
| `DRONE_RPC_SECRET`          | Necessary for proper secured authentication between Drone and runners. Use `openssl rand -hex 16` for generating a valid token. |
| `DRONE_USER_CREATE`         | The initial user to create at launch. Put your Gitea username here for setting automatically Gitea user as drone administrator. |

It's time to go to <https://drone.sw.okami101.io/> and generate your first Drone account through OAuth2 from Gitea. You should be properly redirected to Gitea, where you'll just have to authorize Drone application.

[![Gitea oauth2](gitea-oauth2.png)](gitea-oauth2.png)

Finalize registration, and you should finally arrive to main Drone dashboard. If you have already created some repositories, they should appear in the list.
